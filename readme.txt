Embed media from Archive.org

== Description ==
Embed audio, video, and text content from Archive.org using the core/embed block. 

== Archive.org ==
When pasting an archive.org link into the Editor, the plugin connects to the Internet Archive's API to obtain information about the requested resource, it's needed to embed content from the Interent Archive.

When a page inlcudes the Archive.org iframe, it typically sends the following data:
1. Embed URL of the Page: The Page requests the URL of the archive.org document that the user wants to view in its embedded form.
2. User Agent Information: The browser may send information about the user's browser and operating system.
3. Referrer Information: The browser may send the referrer URL, which is the URL of the page that linked to the archived page.
4. Timestamp Information: The browser may send the timestamp of the request to specify the exact date and time the user wants to view the archived page.

The service is provided by the "Internet Archive": [terms of use](https://archive.org/about/terms).
